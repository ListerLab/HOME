#HOME  
HOME (histogram of methylation) is a python package for differential methylation region (DMR) identification. 
The method uses histogram of methylation features and the linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify DMRs
from whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data.HOME can identify both pairwise and time series DMRs with or without replicates. ######
